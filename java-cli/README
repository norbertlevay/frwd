FRWD_CmdLine is a windows appliation.
In linux runs under wine. 

unzip FRWD_CmdLine to "Program Files" directory.

In linux: edit frwd script to add full path to install directory.
and place the script somewhere into PATH.

OR

system wide settings needed:
-- device.dll and other dlls must be is system Path inside Registry!
-- java.exe from jre must be in wine/windows PATH (in Registry?)
-- jre java.exe must find frwd-cmdline.jar

NOTE:
Registry can be added from commadn line in wine (claims Windows comaptinility):

wine regedit /E here.log

for instance this exports all registry into here.log

From winetricks manual:
DLLs usually get loaded in the following order: 
1. The directory the program was started from. 
2. The current directory. 
3. The Windows system directory. 
4. The Windows directory. 
5. The PATH variable directories.

Also from winehq:
Wine passes all linux environment settings to windows.
Except those which have the same name in linux too:
PATH TEMP SYSTEM <-Those must be set in registry:
To set them you should launch wine regedit and then go to the 

HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment
key. Now you can create or modify the values of the variables you need 

"System" = "c:\\windows\\system"
This sets up where the Windows system files are. The Windows system directory should reside below the directory used for the Windows setting. Thus when using /usr/local/wine_c_windows as Windows path, the system directory would be /usr/local/wine_c/windows/system. It must be set with no trailing slash, and you must be sure that you have write access to it. 

"Temp" = "c:\\temp"
This should be the directory you want your temp files stored in, /usr/local/wine_c/temp in our previous example. Again, no trailing slash, and write access!!! 

"Path" = "c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system;c:\\blanco"
Behaves like the PATH setting on UNIX boxes. 
When Wine is run like wine sol.exe, 
if sol.exe resides in a directory specified in the Path setting, 
Wine will run it (of course, if sol.exe resides in the 
current directory, Wine will run that one). Make sure it always
has your windows directory and system directory (for this setup, it must contain "c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system").

OR

Wine supports the WINEPATH variable. If, in your Unix Shell, you export WINEPATH, once you launch wine it will use this to populate the PATH environment variable inside wine.
Example:

$ WINEPATH=anything\\it//willNotBeParsed wine cmd
Wine CMD Version 5.1.2600 (1.6.2)

C:\>echo %PATH%
anything\it//willNotBeParsed;C:\windows\system32;C:\windows;C:\windows\system32\wbem
