= distVShrB / check dates: 

- add check frwdDistanceVsTime m-file: timeDist both columns should be monoton increasing

- Clarify distance estimates:
-- A: FRWD Replayer graphical tables/drawings distance data
-- B: XML file
-- C: csv file saved directly from HW
Seems that FRWD_Replayer gui is doing curve smoothing not present in 
XML-file. 
(once - see text below - also observed that csv file from HW (frwd-cli java)
has also different disatance comapred to XML (or was it FRWD Replayer?)
DONE - QUESTION clarified: 
- dphbLoad(): there are duplicate entries (by date/daynumber) however
different distance (and distPerHR): 
these dupliates are probably saved by linux frwd-cli and
saved in Windows FRWD Replayer (and the copied to linux):
does original sw FRWD Replayer do some smoothing/filtering whereas 
frwd-cli saves directly data from the logger-device ?
ANSWER: Yes, looks so, frwd-cli based distance (simple unfiltered 
sum of distances at each second) yields 50..70\% bigger exercise distance
them FRWD Replayer result -> FRWD Replayer is doing some filtering 
(Actually I had filterbank implemented in ada and that reduced the
overestimate to from 59--70\% downto 30\% )

- DONE (implemented check on filename date and manually fixed in ~10 files) 
     increasing by date/daynumber:
     ---- dphbLoad(distVShrB): also time column should be ordered by time,
     but there are jumps (at indeces 18, 121 and 271) - 
     some files have wrongly named date ?

- DONE ada code, csvfile: must always write to csvfile 20 columns 
(otherwise octave will not load)
OR write incomplete lines as comments (with # on the begining)
seems that there was last line without the 4 RRx values...(2009 May 20 log)

- DONE also in previous case, the line had Fix marked as valid, even if no data
harden check for meas-set validity: (fix == 1 AND siv > 0)
